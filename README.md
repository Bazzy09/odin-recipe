This project is a depiction of the HTML skills I have learned so far through The Odin Project's cirriculum.
In this project I showcased:
Setting up and HTML document using the HTML boilerplate.
Using text in HTML (paragraphs, headers, bold words, and italicized words).
Using tags and elements, of course!
Using unordered and ordered lists.
Adding images, links, and using multiple files.
